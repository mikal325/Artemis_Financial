# Artemis_Financial
Artemis Financial is a global company aiming to help their clients by providing financial planning, including savings, retirement, investments and insurance.  They are seeking ways to increase their security to better serve their clients.
While assisting Artemis Financial I was able to identify security issues that they were experiencing, at the time that this document was written, they were meerly looking for what security errors were prominent, so that they could begin finding solutions to remove said errors and vulnerabilities from their program.
The hardest part was doing the initial Maven dependency check, due to the initial integration of Maven into my eclipse IDE, and working through it.
I increased security for Artemis Financial by reccommending a couple of good cipher algorithms to help increase security.  I reccommended ARC-4 for them.
